# 🔐 Password Strength Checker – DevOps Project

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **DevOps workflow** by developing a simple **Password Strength Checker** CLI application using **Python**, integrating it with a **SQLite database**, and deploying it via a **CI/CD pipeline** using **GitHub**, **Docker**, **Jenkins**, **Terraform**, and **AWS EC2**.

The solution covers:

- ✅ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
- ✅ Source Code Management (SCM) with Git and GitHub
- ✅ CI/CD automation with Jenkins
- ✅ Containerization with Docker
- ✅ Infrastructure-as-Code with Terraform
- ✅ Integration with a database (SQLite)
- ✅ DevOps principles such as branching, abstraction, and refactoring
